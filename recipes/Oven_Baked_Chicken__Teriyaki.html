    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Oven-Baked Teriyaki Chicken is a flavorful and easy-to-make dish featuring tender, juicy chicken breasts coated in a rich, homemade teriyaki sauce.
    The sauce, made with soy sauce, mirin, ginger, garlic, and a touch of red pepper flakes, is thickened to a perfect consistency and generously poured over the chicken before baking.
    As it bakes, the sauce caramelizes slightly, infusing the meat with a sweet, savory, and slightly spicy glaze. 
    Serve this delicious dish with steamed rice and vegetables for a satisfying meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>1 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicke breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until dissolved; set aside. Combine soy sauce, sugar, mirin, ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes together in a saucepan over medium heat until the mixture starts to simmer. Slowly whisk in cornstarch mixture. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; arrange in a baking dish. Pour sauce over chicken breasts, coating all sides.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
